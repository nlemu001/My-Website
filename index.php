					Hi there! My name is Neri, let me tell you a little about myself: <br>

					 - Born and raised in Southern California. <br>
					 - University of California, Riverside Graduate - Computer Engineering 2015 <br>
					 - Avid Runner (my slow pace is irrelevant! haha) <br>
					 - I love playing guitar (of the physical and air varieties) <br>
					 - I would not be where I am without the amazing support of my family, best friends and God's unending grace. <br><br><br>

					 The goal of this site is to give you a better sense of who I am and what I love to do the most. There are two main sections here: My interests and experience as a 
					 professional as well as a person. <br>
					 Here you will find a showcase of the projects I've worked on, some while I was in school, 
					 others as a personal project and others as work for others. There's also a more interactive 
					 version of my resume (as well as a hard copy for your viewing pleasure). <br><br>

					 So feel free to have a look around! And if you have some feedback on the layout/design/content, please let me know! I love hearing others' opinions and how I can improve my craft!
